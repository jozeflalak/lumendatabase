Lumen Database
================

The Lumen Database collects and analyzes legal complaints and requests for removal of online materials, helping Internet users to know their rights and understand the law. These data enable us to study the prevalence of legal threats and let Internet users see the source of content removals.

Automated Submissions and Search Using the API
===========
The main [Lumen Database instance](https://www.lumendatabase.org/) has an API that allows individuals and organizations that receive large numbers of notices to submit them without using the web interface. The API also provides an easy way for researchers to search the database. Members of the public can test the database, but will likely need to request an API key from the [Lumen team](mailto:team@lumendatabase.org) to receive a token that provides full access. To learn about the capabilities of the API, you can consult the [API documentation](https://github.com/berkmancenter/lumendatabase/wiki/Lumen-API-Documentation).

Development
===========

#### Requirements

* ruby 2.5.5
* PostgreSQL 9.6
* Elasticsearch 5.6.x
* Java Runtime Environment (OpenJDK works fine)
* Piwik Tracking (only used in prod)
* Mail server (SMTP, Sendmail)
* phantomjs (used only by test runner)

#### Setup

By default, the app will try to connect to Elasticsearch on `http://localhost:9200`. If you want to use a different host set the `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` environment variable.

    $ bundle install
    $ cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
      (edit database.yml as you wish)
      (ensure PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch are running)
    $ rails db:setup
    $ rails lumen:set_up_cms

#### Running the app

    $ rails s

#### Viewing the app

    $BROWSER 'http://localhost:3000'

You can customize behavior during seeding (db:setup) with a couple of environment variables:

* `NOTICE_COUNT=10` will generate 10 (or any number you pass it) notices
  instead of the default 500
* `SKIP_FAKE_DATA=1` will skip generating fake seed data entirely.

#### Sample user logins

The seed data creates logins of the following form:

    Username: {username}@lumendatabase.org
    Password: password

username is one of {user, submitter, redactor, publisher, admin, super_admin},
with corresponding privileges.

If you seeded your database with an older version of `seeds.rb`, your username
may use chillingeffects.org rather than lumendatabase.org.

#### Running Tests

    $ rspec

The integration tests are quite slow; for some development purposes you may
find it more convenient to `bundle exec rspec spec/ --exclude-pattern="spec/integration/*"`.

If `elasticsearch` isn't on your $PATH, set `ENV['TEST_CLUSTER_COMMAND']=/path/to/elasticsearch`, and make sure permissions are set correctly for your test suite to run it.

If you're running a subset of tests that you know don't require Elasticsearch,
you can run them without setting it up via
`TEST_WITH_ELASTICSEARCH=0 rspec path/to/tests`.

#### Parallelizing Tests
You can speed up tests by running them in parallel:
    $ rake parallel:spec

You will need to do some setup before the first time you run this:
- alter `config/database.yml` so that the test database is `yourproject_test<%= ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER'] %>`
- run `rake parallel:setup`

It will default to using the number of processors parallel_tests believes to be available, but you can change this by setting `ENV['PARALLEL_TEST_PROCESSORS']` to the desired number.

#### Linting

Use rubocop and leave the code at least as clean as you found it. If you make linting-only changes, it's considerate to your code reviewer to keep them in their own commit.

####  Profiling

* [Skylight](https://www.skylight.io/app/applications/utm46ElcSDtw/recent/5m/endpoints)
  * track page rendering time, count allocations, find possibly dodgy SQL
  * analytics to help you find the problem areas at a high level
  * login required
  * runs in prod
* [mini-profiler](https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler)
  * available in dev by default
  * in use on prod, visible only to super_admins
  * in-depth memory profiling, stacktracing, and SQL queries; good for granular analysis
* [bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet)
  * find N+1 queries and unused eager loading
  * runs in dev
  * logs to `log/bullet.log`
* [oink](https://github.com/noahd1/oink)
  * memory usage, allocations
  * more specific than Skylight as to which objects are being created where
  * runs in dev by default; can run anywhere by setting `ENV[LUMEN_USE_OINK]` (ok to run in production)
  * logs to `log/oink.log`

#### Environment variables

Here are all the environment variables which Lumen recognizes. Find them in the code for documentation.

Environment variables should be set in `.env` and are managed by the `dotenv` gem. `.env` is not version-controlled so you can safely write secrets to it (but will also need to set these on all servers).

Unless setting an environment variable on the command line in the context of a command-line process, environment variables should ONLY be set in `.env`.

Most of these are optional and have sensible defaults (which may vary by environment).

- `BATCH_SIZE` - batch size of model items indexed during each run of Elasticsearch re-indexing
- `BUNDLE_GEMFILE`
- `BROWSER_VALIDATIONS` - enable user html5 browser form validations
- `DEFAULT_SENDER` - default mailer sender
- `ELASTICSEARCH_URL`
- `EMAIL_DOMAIN`
- `ES_INDEX_SUFFIX` - can be used to specify a suffix for the name of elasticsearch indexes
- `FILE_NAME` - name of csv file to import as blog entries
- `from` - a date formatted `'%Y-%m-%d'` for use in recreating elasticsearch indexes after said date
- `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_BLOG_SEARCH_ID`
- `IMPORT_NAME`
- `LOG_ELASTICSEARCH` - only used in tests
- `LUMEN_USE_OINK`
- `MAILER_DELIVERY_METHOD`
- `NOTICE_COUNT` - how many fake notices to create when seeding the db
- `RACK_ENV` - don't use this; it's overridden by `RAILS_ENV`
- `RAILS_ENV`
- `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL`
- `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES` - if present (with any value) will enable rails to serve static files
- `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` - reCAPTCHA public key
- `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` - reCAPTCHA private key
- `RETURN_PATH` - default mailer return path
- `SEARCH_SLEEP` - used in specs only, time out of Elasticsearch searches
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE` - the Rails secret token; _required in prod_
- `SITE_HOST` - site host, used in mailer templates
- `SKIP_FAKE_DATA` - don't generate fake data when seeding the database
- `SMTP_ADDRESS` - SMTP server address
- `SMTP_DOMAIN` - SMTP server domain
- `SMTP_USERNAME` - SMTP server username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` - SMTP server password
- `SMTP_PORT` - SMTP server port
- `SMTP_VERIFY_MODE`
- `TEST_CLUSTER_COMMAND`
- `USER_CRON_EMAIL` - for use in sending reports of court order files; can be a string or a list (in a JSON.parse-able format)
- `USER_CRON_MAGIC_DIR`
- `WEB_CONCURRENCY` - number of Unicorn workers
- `WEB_TIMEOUT` - Unicorn timeout
- The following are used only for imports from oldchill:
  - `BASE_DIRECTORY`
  - `MYSQL_DATABASE`
  - `MYSQL_HOST`
  - `MYSQL_USERNAME`
  - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
  - `MYSQL_PORT`
  - `RESTART_SEQUENCE_WITH` - for compatibility between oldchill imports and new Lumen notices. Should not ever be needed at this point, nor have any effect in production.
  - `WHERE`

#### Email setup

The application requires a mail server, in development it's best to use a local SMTP server that will catch all outgoing emails. [Mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me) is a good option.

Ephemera
========

The `/blog_entries` page can contain a google custom search engine that
searches the Lumen blog. To enable, create a custom search engine
[here](https://www.google.com/cse/create/new) restricted to the path the blog
lives at, for instance `https://www.lumendatabase.org/blog_entries/*`. Extract
the "cx" id from the javascript embed code and put it in the
`GOOGLE_CUSTOM_BLOG_SEARCH_ID` environment variable. The blog search will
appear after this variable has been configured.

Lumen API
=========
You can search the database and, if you have a contributor token, add to the database using our API.

The Lumen API is documented in our GitHub Wiki: https://github.com/berkmancenter/lumendatabase/wiki/Lumen-API-Documentation
